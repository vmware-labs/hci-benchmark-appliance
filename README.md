# hci-benchmark-appliance

## Overview

## Try it out

### Prerequisites

* Web Browser: IE8+, Firefox or Chrome
* vSphere 6.5 and later environments for both HCIBench and its client VMs deployment
* Before deploying HCIBench the environment must meet the following requirements:
•   The cluster is created and configured properly
•   The network that will be used by the Guest VM is defined on all the hosts in the cluster. If a DHCP service is available, the Guest VM can obtain their network configurations from the DHCP server. If the network does not have DHCP service or an insufficient number of IP addresses
HCIBench can assign static IP address. To accomplish this, the HCIBench source network “VM Network” must be mapped to the same network as the guest VM (Fig. 2)
•   The vSphere environment where the tool is deployed can access the vSAN Cluster environment to be tested
